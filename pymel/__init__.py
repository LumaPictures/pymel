          PyMEL
*******************************

PyMEL makes python scripting in Maya work the way it should. Maya's command module is a direct
translation of MEL commands into python functions. The result is a very awkward and unpythonic syntax which
does not take advantage of python's strengths -- particularly, a flexible, object-oriented design. PyMEL
builds on the cmds module by organizing many of its commands into a class hierarchy, and by
customizing them to operate in a more succinct and intuitive way.
