# This is the default pymel configuration file.
# Pymel determines which configuration file to use by:
#    1. If a 'PYMEL_CONF' environment variable is defined, and the value it contains is an
#         existing file, this file is used
#    2. If a 'pymel.conf' file exists in the $HOME directory, this is used
#    3. Otherwise, the 'pymel.conf' file in the root pymel directory is used.

## The path_class option can be set to the name of an alternate base class for the Path class.
## It must include the module name where the class can be found
#path_class=luma.Filepath

## uncomment to allow instantiation of non-existent PyNode objects. this option will probably
## be removed in future versions and is offered to provide a grace period for those upgrading from
## pymel 0.7.
#0_7_compatibility_mode=on

## By default, in a standalone interpreter, pymel will attempt to do a full initialization of your MEL environment, such
## as sourcing userPrefs.mel, pluginPrefs.mel, and userSetup.mel.
## If this is undesirable, uncomment this option.  Alternately, you can set the environment variable PYMEL_SKIP_MEL_INIT
## to any value.
#skip_mel_init=on

## By default pymel will attempt to dynamically load the initial plugins by sourcing initialPlugins.mel. These plugins
## are dynamically loaded in maya, but not in maya batch or maya prompt. It also loads core maya plugins, the first time
## a release of maya is started.
## Uncomment this option to disable dynamically loading initial plugins.
#skip_initial_plugins=on

## mayapy in from 2011 on, has had a bug where it will segfault when exiting -
## if maya.standalone.initialize() is not called before exit. pymel installs
## some callbacks to try to ensure this happens - set this to off to disable
## this behavior
#fix_mayapy_segfault=off

## Older versions of pymel could attempt to fix this problem in a slightly
## different way, by installing an atexit handler that would do a "hard exit"
## with os._exit.  However, this only worked in Linux, and was a hackier
## solution, so it has now been deprecated, and turned off by default.
#fix_linux_mayapy_segfault=on

## By default pymel and the maya api do not check if a node is referenced before setting the lock state of an attribute.
## Mel and maya.cmds will raise errors for this situation.  Setting the lock state with pymel and the maya api is
## unsafe because changes to the locked state on referenced nodes are not saved with the scene.  To maintain backwards
## compatibility, pymel will not check if a node is referenced before changing the locked state.  To break backwards
## compatibility and safely perform lock changes, set the following variable to on.
#check_attr_before_lock=on

## pymel.core.uitypes has some utility methods for getting python qt objects from
## maya-gui names. This setting controls whether PySide or PyQt objects should
## be preferred. The setting will only be used if BOTH (or, technically,
## neither) are available - if only one is available, that module will always be
## used. If not set, it currently defaults to pyqt.
