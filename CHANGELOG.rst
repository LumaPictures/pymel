==================================

----------------------------------
Additions
----------------------------------
- all: Add support for maya-2023 and python 3.9

==================================
Version 1.1.0
==================================

----------------------------------
Non-Backward Compatible Changes
----------------------------------
- removed support for maya versions before 2017
- general: AttributeSpec.parent() now returns None instead of erroring
- datatypes: Quaternion.asEulerRotation now returns a datatypes.EulerRotation
  as intended, instead of OpenMaya.MEulerRotation; since dt.EulerRotation
  inherits from om.MEulerRotation, they should mostly be compatible, but if you
  need a om.MEulerRotation, just cast directly - ie,
  om.MEulerRotation(dt.Quaternion().asEulerRotation())
- uitypes: OptionMenuGrp.getParent() now returns a PyUI object, instead of a
  string, as intended.  This brings it's behavior in line with most other PyUI
  .getParent() calls, including RowLayout.getParent() and Layout.getParent(),
  from which OptionMenuGrp inherits
- uitypes: PopupMenu.getItemArray() now returns PyUI objects, instead of
  strings, as intended.  This brings it's behavior in line with Menu
  .getItemArray(), from which it inherits
- nodetypes: Due to a bug, the following methods were wrapped on a random
  scattering of subclasses of the named classes. They were ever intended to be
  wrapped at all.  They are all being removed - exact methods and reasoning
  below:

  - **DagNode.setObject**: dangerous - changes the node we're wrapping out from
    underneath us
  - **DependNode.addAttribute**: dangerous, because it only took
    AttributeSpec objects as inputs. In addition to being fairly obscure,
    they are mostly constructed from existing attributes - but the API
    explicitly warns against adding an attribute using an MObject that's already
    added to another node. Use addAttr method instead.
  - **DependNode.attribute**: too confusing to have both "attr" and "attribute"
    which return different types of objects. Use attrSpec instead. Also, the old
    wrap only worked with integer indices, which wasn't useful in most
    situations (attrSpec works with either string names, Attribute objects, or
    indices).
  - **DependNode.findPlug**: dangerous, as it allowed returning networked mplugs.
    Use attr method instead. The api docs warn that networked plugs should not
    be used if you might be breaking connections, thus why these are
    considerered dangerous. Also, it only worked when fed AttributeSpec, a
    little known / used part of pymel.
  - **DependNode.reorderedAttribute**: obscure, and apparently only useful
    during file IO
  - **Shape.dagPath**: useless, as it just always returned self
  - **Shape.getPath**: useless, as it just always returned self

----------------------------------
Changes
----------------------------------
- all: The basic way methods and commands are wrapped has been altered.
  Formerly, all items were wrapped dynamically, at runtime; now, they are
  wrapped and "baked", using templates, when a pymel release is made. The end
  result should be code that is more much readable and understandable for end
  users.
- all: Converted to a new .py/.pyc.zip cache format. Improved pymel import
  times, in addition to being more readable/diffable/maintainable
- general: AttributeDefaults renamed to AttributeSpec, which better reflects
  what it is: a specification for the type on an attribute, not associated with
  any single node.  The AttributeDefaults name is preserved as an alias for
  backwards compatibility.
- nodetypes: Due to a bug, the following methods were wrapped on a random
  scattering of subclasses of the named classes. They were ever intended to be
  wrapped at all.  They are being marked as deprecated, and will raise a
  warning, if used on any of the subclasses for which they are implemented:

    DependNode.findAlias, DependNode.getAffectedAttributes, DependNode
    .getAffectedByAttributes, DependNode.getAliasList, DependNode
    .getConnections, DependNode.plugsAlias, DependNode.setAlias, Transform
    .getRotationQuaternion, Transform.setRotationQuaternion

- nodetypes: The following methods were removed from Shape: model, removeChild,
  and removeChildAt. They were never intended to be wrapped, and were non-
  functional, so removing them should not introduce any backwards-compatibility
  issues.
- nodetypes:Shape.getAllPaths was moved from Shape to DagNode, and marked
  deprecated. It was only wrapped as a result of a bug, it has a misleading name
  (it returns PyNodes, not paths), and is functionally equivalent to
  getInstances(). However, since it may have been in use, and we don't wish to
  break backward compatibility, we are marking it as deprecated.  We are moving
  it to DagNode, instead of Shape, because the fact that it was defined on
  Shape and not Transform made it give incorrect / misleading results.  This is
  because the Transform node will check it's first shape for attributes it
  can't find defined on itself - the net result is that, even though it's not
  defined on Transform, if it had a shape, it would "appear" to be, but return
  the "wrong" results - ie PyNodes corresponding to all instances of the
  first shape, NOT the transform itself.
- nodetypes: AnimCurve.timedAnimCurveTypeForPlug/unitlessAnimCurveTypeForPlug
  turned into classmethods, as they don't require / operate on a specific
  AnimCurve
- conf: add a new setting to pymel.conf, "deleted_pynode_name_access", to
  to control the behavior when a deleted node's name is queried / used.  The
  current behavior - of issuing a warning, but returning the old name - is now
  deprecated, and at some point the default will be changed to "error", which
  will cause pymel to raise a DeletedMayaNodeError.  If you wish to keep the
  old behavior - and not be nagged that it may be changed at some point the
  future - change the setting to "warn".  You may also set it to "ignore" if you
  want to not even issue a warning. (The current default setting is
  "warn_deprecated", which will behave just like "warn", except with an
  additional FutureWarning to remind you to change the setting in pymel.conf)
- util: Singleton: eliminate DeprecationWarning for object.__init__(*p, **k)
- nodetypes: tweak new constraint-weight-query syntax - we now allow
  constraint(q=1, weight=True), instead of constraint(q=1, weight=[]); also,
  may use a tuple (or other non-list iterable) for weight

- general: remove unused kwargs for Attribute.affects/affected
- uitypes: make a base PyUIContainer parent class for Layout and Window
- mel2py: removed findMelOnlyCommands(), as it wasn't working, unused, and never
  intended to be publicly exposed.
  (https://github.com/LumaPictures/pymel/issues/412)

----------------------------------
Additions
----------------------------------
- all: Add maya-2019 support
- all: python-3 / "typing" style type comments added to many / most commands
  and methods
- general: AttributeSpec may now be constructed from a string (which names an
  existing Attribute), an Attribute, an MPlug, or another AttributeSpec.
  DependNode.attrSpec now also accepts all these objects as well.
- uitypes: Many layout flags were were not wrapped on Layout; they now are,
  which also means all sub-classes inherit these methods as well (though many
  subclasses already had their own overrides for many of these commands). The
  full set of new methods on Layout is:

    dragCallback, dropCallback, getAnnotation, getBackgroundColor, getChildArray,
    getDocTag, getEnable, getEnableBackground, getFullPathName, getHeight,
    getHighlightColor, getIsObscured, getManage, getNumberOfChildren,
    getNumberOfPopupMenus, getPopupMenuArray, getPreventOverride, getVisible,
    getVisibleChangeCommand, getWidth, noBackground, setAnnotation,
    setBackgroundColor, setDocTag, setEnable, setEnableBackground, setHeight,
    setHighlightColor, setManage, setPreventOverride, setVisible,
    setVisibleChangeCommand, setWidth, statusBarMessage

- nodetypes: Some api method wraps were re-enabled on DependNode, DagNode, and
  ObjectSet. Formerly, some of these methods were implemented on some
  subclasses of these node types; they are now uniformly available on the base
  node.  Note that some of these methods represent new functionality, while
  others merely duplicate existing functionality (ie, DagNode.partialPathName
  <=> DagNode.name); however, we wanted to provide a uniform interface, and did
  not want to break backward compatibility, so they were enabled on their base
  classes. The set of new methods is:

    Camera.getFarClippingPlane, Camera.setFarClippingPlane,
    Camera.getNearClippingPlane, Camera.setNearClippingPlane,
    DagNode.fullPathName, DagNode.isInstancedAttribute, DagNode.partialPathName,
    DagNode.setInstanceable, DependNode.allocateFlag, DependNode.attributeClass,
    DependNode.deallocateAllFlags, DependNode.deallocateFlag,
    DependNode.dgCallbacks, DependNode.dgTimer, DependNode.dgTimerOff,
    DependNode.dgTimerOn, DependNode.dgTimerQueryState, DependNode.dgTimerReset,
    DependNode.getAliasAttr, DependNode.hasAttribute, DependNode.isNewAttribute,
    DependNode.removeAttribute, DependNode.setFlag, DependNode.typeName,
    ObjectSet.addMember, ObjectSet.isMember, ObjectSet.removeMember

- nodetypes: Transform.rotateByQuaternion added, and accepts either a
  Quaternion/MQuaternion or four separate floats
- nodetypes: DependNode.deleteAttr now accepts Attribute objects (first
  verifying that it is an attribute on the same node as self)
- nodetypes: Added a DependNode.typeName classmethod - similar to
  DependNode.type / general.nodeType, but unlike those, it does not require an
  actual instance of a node, or call any mel / api functions - instead, it just
  returns the type that the given class wraps.  When called from an instance,
  should always give the same result as DependNode.type, since pymel always
  ensures that the most specific node class is used to create any PyNode
- nodetypes: Undo support added to a number of AnimCurve methods:

    addKeys, addKeysWithTangents, insertKey, remove, setAngle, setBreakdown,
    setInTangentType, setOutTangentType, setPostInfinityType,
    setPreInfinityType, setTangentTypes, setTangentsLocked, setTime,
    setUnitlessInput, setValue, setWeight, setWeighted, setWeightsLocked

- util.enum: EnumValue objects now have a __hash__, and so can be stored in dicts / sets
- versions: add v2018_1, v2018_1, v2018_2, v2019_3, v2019
- general: added getDefault method to Attribute class - thanks Bob White!
- language: allow optionvars to save long types - thanks Jordan Hueckstaedt!
- all: standardize on numpy-style docstrings with PEP484 type annotations.
- general: allow adding of 2 (1-dimensional) components - ie, you can now add
  two MeshVertex objects, containing verts for the same mesh, together to get
  a new MeshVertex object representing their union
- nodetypes: add Transform.getRotateOrientation / setRotateOrientation
  these are distinct from the existing getRotateAxis / setRotateAxis
  (from MEL), because they operate on quaternions, which are what the
  transform "actually" stores under the hood - and so it seems potentially
  useful to give direct access.
- general: expand types of objects that AttributeSpec constructor accepts -
  str, Attribute object, AttributeSpec object, MPlug, MObject
- nodetypes: make DependNode.deleteAttr work with Attribute
- datatypes: expand set of things you can construct a Quaternion with: lists
  of floats, ints, another Quaternion, an MQuaternion, axis-angle, rotate
  vector-to-vector
- nodetypes: added an undoable Camera.setNearFarClippingPlanes
- system: UndoChunk can take an optional chunk "name" to show up in undo list
- nodetypes: make creation of RenderLayer() / DisplayLayer() use mel cmds
  this way, they are hooked up to renderLayerManager / displayLayerManager
  also, gives more options on creation. However, they are created empty by
  default, to match old behavior

----------------------------------

- nodetypes: fixed issue with DependNode.attrSpec incorrectly caching dynamic
  attrs

  plugin init - ie, some mtoa nodes get created outside of the plugin init
- core: fix for plugin unloaded callback when using plugin name with extension -
  ie, pm.unloadPlugin("myPlugin.py")
- nodetypes: make TransferAttribute use MFnWeightGeometryFilter
- nodetypes: AnimCurve.addKey / evaluate / AnimCurve.findClosest now work for
  all curve types, not just time-to-float types
- nodetypes: fix for creation of Locator() - thanks bob-white!
- nodetypes: fix DisplayLayer.removeMembers - thanks Akshay!
- general: deal with connectAttr error that contains unicode
  (https://github.com/LumaPictures/pymel/issues/402)
- nodetypes: fix bug when creating AngleBetween node
  (https://github.com/LumaPictures/pymel/issues/416)

==================================
Version 1.0.6
==================================

----------------------------------
Non-Backward Compatible Changes
----------------------------------

- joint.limitSwitchX/Y/Z: now return [bool, bool] when queried, just like the mel command, to indicate whether the limit is on for the min/max

- ipymel: update for ipython 0.11
- util.arguments: compareCascadingDicts can show which keys have been added (as opposed to just changed)
- system: added workspace.expandName

----------------------------------
Bugfixes
----------------------------------

- general: for the keyframe command, the upper / lower limits substituted in for the "index" flag, when no upper/lower limits were given, are now correct; formerly, the behavior of index=":" would vary depending on where (in time) the first and last keyframes were
- general: timerange flags (ie, keyframe(time=...), findKeyframe(time=...), etc) now provide correct results when no upper/lower limits given; formerly, the time=":" would vary depending on if / which objects were selected
- animation: Joint.angleX/Y/Z and Joint.stiffnessX/Y/Z now work
- nodetypes: Container.getParentContainer, Container.getRootTransform, and Character.getClipScheduler now all return None instead of raising a runtime error if no object was found
- system: FileReference.fullNamespace and iterReferences/listReferences with namespaces=1 now handle situations where reference node itself is in a non-root namespace correctly
- general: when instantiating PyNode from an MPlug, to get the PyNode for the node, create from the underlying mobject, not the name (which may not be unique)
- animation: fix for Joint.getAngleX/Y/Z, .getStiffnessX/Y/Z; joint.radius no longer returns list

- general: cmds.group returns unique name in maya > 2014
- fix for virtual classes
- versions: parsing for 'Preview Release' format - from Dean Edmonds

==================================
Version 1.0.5
==================================

----------------------------------
Non-Backward Compatible Changes
----------------------------------

- DagNode.isVisible:  has a new flag, checkOverride, which is on by default, and considers visibility override settings
- referenceQuery/FileReference.getReferenceEdits: if only one of successfulEdits/failedEdits is given, and it is false, we now assume that the desire is to return the other type (and set that flag to true); formerly, this would result in NO edits being returned
- parent no longer raises an error if setting an object's parent to it's current parent; this makes it behave similarly to the mel command, and to DagNode.setParent
- renameFile now automatically sets the 'type' if none is supplied (helps avoid renaming a file to 'foo.ma', then saving it as 'mayaBinary')
- general: 1D components have index() method: can no longer use string.index()
- uitypes: make PyUI.parent return None instead of PyUI('')

----------------------------------
Changes
----------------------------------

- for maya versions >= 2012, creation of "ghost" plugin nodes no longer needed
- general: change to Component to speed up len(PyNode('pCube1Shape').vtx)

- general: speedup for string representation of complete MeshVertexFace
- general: made listRelatives/listHistory/listConnections have same behavior for None and empty list
- system: clarified doc not about removeReferenceEdits not erroring
- system: FileReference.replaceWith - enable kwargs
- system: renameFile automatically sets type
- system: changed referenceQuery so when only one of successful/failed passed, other flag is opposite value
- language: make catch take args/kwargs
- nodetypes: attrDefaults - use MNodeClass in versions >= 2012, _GhostObjMaker otherwise
- nodetypes: Transform.setRotation now takes args as EulerRotation, Quaternion, or iterable of 3 or 4 elements
- nodetypes: isVisible checks overrideVisibility
- stubs: catch more dict-like-objects; special case exclude for maya.precomp.precompmodule
- stubs: create dummy data objects when safe; better handling of builtins
- stubs: use static code analysis to decide whether to include a child module in a parent module's namespace
- stubs: better representations for builtin data types
- stubs: get all names in module, better 'import *' detection
- plogging: added raiseLog func/method
- plogging: small tweaks to way default ERRORLEVEL is set, and raiseLog is added onto loggers
- ipymel: make sure stuff imported into global namespace in userSetup.py is available in IPython
