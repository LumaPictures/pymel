==================================
Version 1.0.10
==================================

----------------------------------
Changes
----------------------------------
- default testing engine changes to pytest (from nose)
- remove ply as requirement, as we have pymel.util.external.ply
- utilitytypes: make LazyLoadModule a class, not func

----------------------------------
Additions
----------------------------------
- added support for 2018
- system: add FileReference.nodes(recursive=True) flag
- Adding pm.isModified function (replacement for cmds.file(q=1, modified=1)
  (thanks, bob-white!)
- Added file reference remove flags (thanks, wesbondie!)
- added mergeNamespaceWithParent and mergeNamespaceWithRoot to
  FileReference.remove to match docs (thanks mjmvisser!)
- add kwargs support to getClassfication - issue #343 (thanks kartikg3!)
- plugins: add FileTranslator plugin helper base class to pymel.api.plugins
- util.enum: add Enum.itervalues
- maintenance: make stub generation more general-purpose; add cli
- stubs: improvements to PEP484 pyi stub file generation
- tests support pytest now

----------------------------------
Bug Fixes
----------------------------------
- fix for Attribute equality for compound multi attrs
- cmds.file(new=1, type='mayaAscii') will crash maya - pm.newFile() will now
  automatically ignore any type/typ flags to avoid this - issue #346
  (thanks bob-white!)
- fix for mesh.numTriangles() raising a TypeErorr - issue #388
  (thanks kartikg3!)
- fix for uitypes.Menu.getItemArray exceptions (thanks bob-white!)
- plogging: fix for setting of root logging level (thanks sdalgo!)
- fix to deal with nodes showing up multiple times in inheritance tree from
  cmds.nodeType (ie, aiSkyDomeLight)
- ipymel now working again with modern versions of IPython
- fix for PyNode becoming invalid if instance is reparented in some situations
- deprecated api-wrapped functions weren't returning values
- dynamically create PyNodes from nodetypes - fixes issue with some maya node
  types that can't get detected on plugin load
- fix for hasParent/hasChild/isParentOf/isChildOf with underworld nodes
- pm.parent will set PyNodes fed in to use the correct instance / parent
- better fix for mayapy segfaults (run maya.standalone.uninitialize)
- factories: some functions using MFloatPoint weren't doing unit conversion
- some node types that are dag nodes don't work with MFnDagNode - however,
  .nodeName() should still work (as that doesn't need MFnDagNode)
- nodetypes: attempt to deal with crash with instances;
  get it when you add an instance of an object, and then access the old object;
  this doesn't completely solve the issue, but it may be impossible to avoid
  completely without a patch for the underlying problem from autodesk
- fix for pm.listNamespaces() returning duplicates weed out - issue #380
  (thanks mjmvisser!)
- datatypes: fix to deal with new swig-generated setattr in 2018
- factories: fix for fromInternalUnits with ref-casts
- factories: fix for isMayaType, for weird types
  (ie, TadskAssetInstanceNode_TdependNode, which is a parent of adskMaterial)
- factories: prefer non-deprecated api methods
- startup: fix some hangs on exit in maya 2016.51
- pymel.conf: fix name of fix_linux_mayapy_segfault
- stubs: fix for detection of os.environ

==================================
Version 1.0.6
==================================

----------------------------------
Non-Backward Compatible Changes

----------------------------------
Bugfixes
----------------------------------

- general: timerange flags (ie, keyframe(time=...), findKeyframe(time=...), etc) now provide correct results when no upper/lower limits given; formerly, the time=":" would vary depending on if / which objects were selected

- referenceQuery/FileReference.getReferenceEdits: if only one of successfulEdits/failedEdits is given, and it is false, we now assume that the desire is to return the other type (and set that flag to true); formerly, this would result in NO edits being returned
- parent no longer raises an error if setting an object's parent to it's current parent; this makes it behave similarly to the mel command, and to DagNode.setParent

==================================
Version 1.0.0
==================================

----------------------------------
Non-Backward Compatible Changes
----------------------------------

- pymel no longer has 'everything' in namespace - use ``pymel.all`` for this
- ``pymel.core.nodetypes`` now moved to it's own namespace
- ``pymel.mayahook.Version`` functionality moved to ``pymel.versions`` module. to compare versions, instead of Version class, use, for example, ``pymel.versions.current()`` >= ``pymel.versions.v2008``
- ``pymel.mayahook.mayautils.getMayaVersion()`` / ``getMayaVersion(extension=True)`` replaced with ``pymel.versions.installName()``
- ``pymel.mayahook.mayautils.getMayaVersion(extension=True)`` replaced with ``pymel.versions.shortName()``
- removed 0_7_compatibility_mode

- removed deprecated and inapplicable string methods from , base of all PyNodes:

- removed Smart Layout Creator in favor of 'with' statement support
- ``DagNode.getParent()`` no longer accepts keyword arguments
- Renamed ``UI`` base class to ``PyUI``
- ``sceneName()`` now returns a Path class for an empty string when the scene is untitled. this makes it conform more to ``cmds.file(q=1, sceneName=1)``
- replaced listNamespace with listNamespace_new from 0.9 line

removed deprecated methods
--------------------------
- ``Attribute``: ``__setattr__``, ``size``
- ``Camera``: ``getFov``, ``setFov``, ``getFilmAspect``
- ``Mesh``: ``vertexCount``, ``edgeCount``, ``faceCount``, ``uvcoordCount``, ``triangleCount``
- ``SelectSet``: ``issubset``, ``issuperset``, ``update``
- Mesh components: ``toEdges``, ``toFaces``, ``toVertices``
- ``ProxiUnicode``: ``__contains__,  __len__, __mod__, __rmod__, __mul__, __rmod__, __rmul__, expandtabs, translate, decode, encode, splitlines, capitalize, swapcase, title, isalnum, isalpha, isdigit, isspace, istitle, zfill``

----------------------------------
Bugfixes
----------------------------------

- fixed issue 65: ``DependencyNode.listAttr()`` broken

- maya bug workaround: changed pluginLoaded callback to API-based for 2009 and later
